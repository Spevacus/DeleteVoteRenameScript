## DeleteVoteRenameScript
Makes it more clear if you've voted to delete/undelete on a Stack Exchange post.

### Installation:
Made with Tampermonkey. Conflicts with other script managers may occur, but I highly doubt it.

Link: [Install](https://github.com/Spevacus/DeleteVoteRenameScript/raw/main/Delete%20Vote%20Rename.user.js)

### What it does:
Effectively completes [this feature request](https://meta.stackexchange.com/q/371810/622284).

If you've voted to delete something, the delete button is replaced with "Retract Delete (votes)" text:

Same applies if you've already voted to undelete something:

Also makes the prompt popup a bit more eyecatching if you're about to retract your vote:

### Compatibility:

Compatible with the [Stack Overflow Unofficial Patch (SOUP)](https://stackapps.com/q/4486). Might submit a pull request for it later idk.
